I would recommend you to opt for symfony routing (for medium to large projects).

FastRoute is a smaller and lightweight alternative that supports named route parameters, parameter pattern matching, route groups.

If you are looking for a full-fledged micro-framework capable of routing, then, you should look for Slim framework documentation.
